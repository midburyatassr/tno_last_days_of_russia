 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_TSAR_MIKHAIL_DESC:0 "Великий князь Михаил Андреевич Романов родился вдали от родины, в Версале, рос в Шотландии, учился в Лондоне и служил в Королевском Австралийском военно-морском флоте во время Второй Мировой войны. Он питал надежды на возвращение на прежде не увиденную родную землю при победе Германии, но они растаяли в конце войны в связи с учреждением нацистами рейхскомиссариатов. Поэтому великий князь остался жить в Австралии и работал инженером авиации, нигде особо не светясь. Пока его не пригласили гостить в Харбин.\n\nВсё начиналось со обычного званого вечера с представителями Белого движения, но закончилось его неофициальной коронацией как императора Михаила II белогвардейскими генералами во главе с атаманом Семёновым в городе Чита. Хотя новоиспечённый царь хотел объяснить им, что брак его родителей был морганатическим и он сам не имел прав на престол, они как будто не слушали и продолжали обращаться к нему как к государю.\n\nТерритория, подконтрольная царю, окружена со всех сторон: на востоке сидит бывший союзник и нынешний враг Константин Родзаевский с его кликой фашистов, на севере находятся остатки Красной Армии, к югу - марионеточные государства Японии и как бы правитель СССР на западе. Вот в такой бедственной ситуации он оказался.\n\nНо он тем не менее попытается улучшить своё положение, только если его генералы позволят ему что-нибудь сказать."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SHEPUNOV_DESC:0 "Борис Николаевич Шепунов был, есть и будет личностью без компромиссов.\n\nЖёсткий противник большевизма в любом его проявлении, он сражался рядом с атаманом Семёновым в период Гражданской войны, стал его протеже и лучшим другом, и последовал за ним в эмиграцию в Харбин после поражения в Забайкалье.\n\nВ новом месте он искал денежной и политической помощи Белому Движению, и вскоре на него вышли японцы с интересным предложением, и он стал членом Бюро Русских Эмигрантов под покровительством Японии. Он работал там специалистом по Советскому Союзу, надеясь найти что-то для сокрушения большевиков.\n\nС распадом СССР и триумфом стран Оси, он подумал, что настал этот долгожданный миг. Вместе с Семёновым и некоторыми сподвижниками он придумал план, по которому они должны были пригласить великого князя из династии Романовых в Харбин и провозгласить его императором. Заговор был успешен, и воздвижение Михаила II как "марионеточного царя" на Дальнем Востоке сделало Белое движение снова легитимным в глазах мира. Но разрыв сотрудничества с фашистами похоронил дальнейшие планы Шепунова о возрождении царской России и превратил его в очередного начальника военной клики в раздробленной России.\n\nС консолидацией Дальнего Востока и смертью атамана Семёнова, он наконец стал главным военным руководителем в Восточной Сибири, а провал заговора лоялистов, желавших дать царю Михаилу всю полноту власти, только укрепил его положение.\n\nОн знает, что нужен другой символ для возрождения империи, поэтому в данное время он правит страной как регент. И пусть все его враги пожалеют о том, что выступили против российского самодержавия."

 POLITICS_NIKITA_ROMANOV_DESC:0 "Никита Александрович Романов, дядя Михаила II и после коронации ставший Никитой I, императором всероссийским, на самом деле является марионеткой.\n\nОн сам знает о своём положении. Знают его министры. Знают и его генералы, которые и дёргают его за ниточки.\n\nА он и не против. Родился он в последние дни старой империи и он прекрасно помнит, как он, молодой князь, бежал от печальной судьбы многих своих родственников. Сначала он осел в Париже, продолжил обучение в Оксфорде, женился, завёл детей и продолжал жить как может. Но Никита не забывал о земле, которая, как он полагал, принадлежит ему по праву, и в 1920-30 гг. был видным деятелем в монархистских кругах в эмиграции. Он ликовал, когда Советский Союз был разгромлен, но был опечален от того факта, что на его родине были установлены германские рейхскомиссариаты и на остальной России началась грызня между разного рода фракциями. Он думал, что российскому самодержавию настал конец.\n\nНо вскоре он получил письмо с приглашением в Читу. Он слышал, что его племянник Михаил стал "царём" при помощи офицеров старой Белой Армии, и, надеясь на какую-нибудь важную должность в Чите, он вместе с семьёй прибыл в неприветливый сибирский город. Здесь он нашёл две вещи: разочарование и союзника в лице Бориса Шепунова, наиболее влиятельного главы читинской клики после смерти Семёнова. Всё изменилось после того, как Михаил Андреевич решился на установление единоличной власти, но провалился. Никита особо не вникал в подробности, но знает, что Михаил был сослан обратно в Австралию, и что Шепунов выдвинул  его кандидатуру в качестве нового императора.\n\nВправду сказать, Никита сам хотел бы иметь какую-нибудь власть. Но он видел, что случилось с Михаилом, и будет доволен и тем, что будет одобрять все указы, которые Шепунов и его клика будут класть ему на стол, и всё ради восстановления романовской монархии, хоть и весьма в урезанном виде. In truth, Nikita would like to have power."

Подобные хвалебные речи слышатся отовсюду в Чите, но в реальности ситуация несколько иная.

 WCH_the_true_heirs_of_harbin_desc:0 "When the Bolsheviks overthrew Alexander Kerensky's unlawful government in the October Revolution, they threw Russia into chaos. The White Army, ourselves included, fought them bravely and for years before being forced to retreat. Keeping the belief of a Tsarist restoration alive, we relocated to the Manchurian city of Harbin and formed both a government-in-exile as well as an unlikely (but necessary) alliance with the Russian Fascist Party.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed in the face of Nazi onslaught we seized our chance and, with Tsar Mikhail II, moved to take our rightful place. But the fascists betrayed us, stopping our advance and splitting our territory. They claim legitimacy, but they have none. With the leadership of Grigoriy Semyonov and his ever-loyal generals, true patriots of Mother Russia, we will defeat them and prove that we are clearly the true heirs of Harbin."

And what is a military without a civilian industry to act as its support, producing anything and everything, from combat rations to supplies needed for logistical support and beyond. Our empire will eventually span the entirety of Russia, and right now we will need to ensure that a precedent is set for the establishment of the Tsar's investments into domestic, civilian industries - not just to support our ever-hungry military, of course, but to guarantee that our state will not repeat the mistakes of the past and ensure that every Russian - from the wealthiest residents of our glittering cities to the poorest of the villages - are taken care of and given the opportunity to earn luxury."

 WCH_mining_knowledge:0 "Siberian Resources"
 WCH_mining_knowledge_desc:0 "Siberia is so frequently portrayed as a vast, unsettled wilderness, covered in marshy swamps and frozen tundras. While this assessment isn't inherently false - it tends to obscure the material value of the land that we currently occupy. Its value isn't what's on top of the earth that we stand on - but instead what's underneath. The region has a large amount of resources that we can exploit, such as silver and copper, for both personal use and export.\n\nMost importantly, however, the paramount resource that any Siberian statelet could covet - coal. Coal is used to power our hungry factories, allowing them to consistently pump out the goods that we need to survive and thrive. We need to invest in the extraction of these resources for the benefit of our state and our economy."

 WCH_Military_investments:0 "The Military's Addendum"
 WCH_Military_investments_desc:0 "No empire is formed, and no empire endures, without a strong military. Without us. Ataman Semyonov, having led us on the long journey to Chita, understands this implicitly. But we find ourselves weakened by budget cuts imposed upon us by the civilians. This is intolerable. Dangerous.\n\nWe have submitted an addendum to the budget currently under review which, if accepted, will ensure that we get the resources we need to prepare for the fights ahead. All we need to do is meet with the Tsar and convince him of the addendum's importance. Without it, the state will not endure."

 WCH_import_industrial_expertise:0 "Contact the Reform Bureaucrats"
 WCH_import_industrial_expertise_desc:0 "It's the sad truth that our industrial body is severely lacking in any sort of expertise or veterancy. Any technical or industrial experts that Chita once harboured were either killed in the decades of strife or fled, apparently anywhere but here. But without those well-versed in industrial management and development, how will we be able to ensure an effective and efficient development of our industry? Clearly, outside help is needed. Many of the White officials, despite residing in Chita, still have significant connections in Harbin and, by extension, Manchuria as a whole. It may be best for us to contact Manchuria's reform bureaucrats - those who had been put in charge of the miraculous industrialization of their state - to see if they have any resources or manpower to spare. Sure, there may be a cost in acquiring their expertise, but surely it's worth it."

 WCH_connecting_chita:0 "The Imperial Transport Commission"
 WCH_connecting_chita_desc:0 "Siberia is, to put it lightly, vast and ill-connected. For many of our soldiers, weeks-long marches are required to get from one place to another, and it's often worse for the peasantry living in the towns and villages within our domain. The economic inefficiencies caused by the logistical issues presented to our administration are simply unacceptable, especially in light of the conflicts that lay just beyond the horizon. We must found the Imperial Transport Commission, headed by the most experienced of our White émigré friends of course, which will be tasked with the connecting of all the towns and major villages within our statelet."

 WCH_industrial_machinery_deal_desc:0 "Our industrial equipment is, to put it diplomatically, terrible. Other, more couth members of our administration have said even truer things about its state. The reality is that most of the equipment that we have in our factories is inherited from the Soviets, and almost all of it is decrepit at best and completely unusable at worst. But you can't make new machines without, well, working machines.\n\nAnd so, we must begin to search for ways to import industrial machinery, for the sole purpose of kick starting our own domestic and civilian sectors - perhaps our old friends in Manchuria can help out. This will not only ensure that we have an operable industrial economy going forward, but that our factories will be able to effectively churn out weaponry and supplies for our soldiers."

 WCH_examining_the_force:0 "The Officers' Requests"
 WCH_examining_the_force_desc:0 "Any good military needs a well-motivated officer corps. We can promise them glory for the future, but for the moment we need to promise them money. They are woefully underpaid and underequipped, but those they lead are much worse off. They are requesting funds - not to line their own pockets but to provide proper equipment to those they command.\n\nTheir requests are noble and just, and surely the Tsar cannot but see the wisdom in ensuring that his loyal soldiers are properly equipped before they bravely face his many enemies. Consequently, funds for this purpose will be added to our budgetary requests."

 WCH_examine_our_artillery_desc:0 "Two world wars have conclusively proven the superiority of artillery on the battlefield as a significant force multiplier, and this is one of the few principles that our older and younger officers both agree upon.\n\nHowever, the artillery we possess is both few in number and antique in manufacture. It may be expensive, but if we invest in a new and modern artillery corps, using our own customized designs and organization, we can ensure that we have the best artillery in Siberia!"

 WCH_new_infrastructure:0 "The Imperial Prospector Corps"

The current production quotas aren't nearly enough to keep up with the rapid - no, exponential - industrial growth that we're witnessing. Without the resources to support the massive increase of factories that we're looking at, well... perish the thought. Mikhail, at the behest of the brightest economists of Chita, has declared the formation of the Imperial Prospector Corps, an organization that will be dedicated to the searching out of mineral deposits within our borders and begin their exploitation. Progress comes at a cost, certainly, and the IPC is well aware of that.

 WCH_public_works_company_desc:0 "In the darkest days of the anarchy that reigned in Siberia following the concrete establishment of our state centered in Chita, unemployment was rampant and many turned into transient workers, often without a home. While things are looking brighter now than they were then, our civilian sector is still suffering.\n\nThus, a number of our prominent economists have proposed founding an Imperial Development Company, a state-run corporation that is put in charge of and sponsors public works projects - organizing them to give people employment and further develop our crippled civilian industry. The reorganization of our civilian sector is paramount to ensure that our state has a functioning economy during the wars of reunification that are ahead."

 WCH_industrialization_desc:0 "With no shortage of assistance from the Imperial Development Company and the Imperial Transport Commission, the industry of Chita, the heart of the White Movement, has gone from terminal to roaring in the matter of months, it seems. As our industry and output get stronger, we continue to construct more factories in an ever-increasing cycle of industrialization.\n\nBut we shouldn't stop here - this industrial growth is only a small step towards our goal - a fully industrialized state spanning from the Pacific to the Baltic. Nonetheless, the models for growth that we have constructed and tested in the area of Chita, and their general success, will act as examples for what we can do in the future. But for now: there is no rest for the brave worker."

 WCH_war_resources:0 "Strategic Resources Extraction"
 WCH_war_resources_desc:0 "While the industrial equipment that we received from Manchuria and abroad helped revive our civilian industry and allowed us to actually operate the factories that we currently possess, sadly, it's not enough for us to expand our resource extraction campaigns. The Imperial Development Company, as effective as it has been so far, seems to be a bottomless pit of demanding further resource allocation to ensure a continued development schedule, and one of the most pressing demands that their administration has come to us with is the implementation of further resource extraction. Thus, we must take on a domestic effort to improve our industrial equipment, as it has now become possible, so that we can take full advantage of the natural resources afforded to us by the bounty of Siberia!"

 WCH_reclamation_act:0 "The Reclamation Act"
 WCH_reclamation_act_desc:0 "Our small enclave has many things - an ever-dedicated officer corps, the best troops that can be conscripted, and factories that belch out refined, industrial goods day in and out. What we are lacking, however, is usable, arable land. Sadly, apart from the city of Chita and a few other mentionable towns and villages, most of the land that is controlled by the Emperor of All Russia and his administration is completely unusable.\n\nVast tracts of marshes and forests so thick that a man could barely pass through the trees. After a wise suggestion whispered into the ear of the Tsar himself, Mikhail II has declared the implementation of the Reclamation Act, a law that puts the Imperial Development Company in charge of clearing unusable land to transform it into tracts of earth that could be used for anything from low-yield farming to training grounds for our troops. Anything's better than the squalid backwaters that the IDC has been tasked with clearing."

 WCH_importing_rifles:0 "Import Japanese Surplus"
 WCH_importing_rifles_desc:0 "The Tsar is told that our industry, fledgling as it may be, works day and night to produce the best equipment for our soldiers. This is a polite fiction. In truth, we do not have the capacity to produce enough rifles, cannons, ammunition for the soldiers we have, let alone those we want to recruit.\n\nDuring the years we spent in Harbin, we made excellent use of equipment given to us by the Japanese. Manchukuo is just across the Argun, and we still have many connections there. Importing a small amount of the vast stockpiles of Japanese arms scattered around the country should prove a simple task."

In this way, we can say that we will never be caught unprepared."

 WCH_the_Far_East_Finest:0 "The Far East's Finest"
 WCH_the_Far_East_Finest_desc:0 "Our military is Siberian, and very few of our soldiers and younger officers have spent time west of the Urals. But this is a strength - if they can survive and thrive here, of all places, they can do so anywhere!\n\nIf we incorporate their knowledge and values into our standard training, we can transform our collection of conscripts, émigrés, and vagrants into the Far East's Finest, a disciplined force seemingly invulnerable to the cold and capable of remaining organized in even the worst of weather. The Tsar wouldn't want it any other way, we're sure of it."

 WCH_the_Tsars_own_division:0 "Imperial Guard Divisions"
 WCH_the_Tsars_own_division_desc:0 "Colloquially, our army is often referred to as 'The Tsar's Finest,' a nickname intended to give pride to the many peasant conscripts making up our forces. But some officers have proposed making the nickname a reality, concentrating a handpicked group of the most loyal, most experienced, and most physically fit soldiers together in specialized units.\n\nThe old Tsars had their Imperial Guard, elite infantry that could not only handle any task but also inspire others to greatness. It is only natural that Tsar Mikhail, the rightful Emperor, has his own."

 WCH_the_tsar_combined_arms:0 "A Unified Doctrine"
 WCH_the_tsar_combined_arms_desc:0 "One of our greatest military struggles is the constant disagreement and infighting between our officers regarding operational doctrine. Older generals cling to the grand battleplans of the Great War, while younger officers propose concepts of combined arms. This paralyzes progress, and can no longer be overlooked.\n\nA decision defining the future of our armed forces must be made. We will hold a conference, including both the oldest and most innovative officers, and presided over by the Tsar. With the eyes of their monarch upon them, they will finally decide upon a unified doctrine."

 WCH_true_modern_warfare:0 "Modern Warfare"
 WCH_true_modern_warfare_desc:0 "While distasteful, we must acknowledge that the Bolsheviks demonstrated innovations in modern warfare. Their application of it against the Germans might have been ineffective, but it nonetheless set a standard for warfare across the vast expanses of Russia.\n\nWar has changed, and it's clear that we need to invest in the mechanization and motorization of our army so as to ensure that our soldiers are well equipped for the realities of Siberian combat, regardless of the protests of some of our older officers. Our empire cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of its predecessors - backwards thinking is to be discouraged at all costs."

 WCH_stabilize_budget:0 "Making Our Play"
 WCH_stabilize_budget_desc:0 "With our civilian industry taken care of and growing, our borders secured with defense schemes in place, and the military's pressing needs attended to, we can finally look outwards and begin the process of finishing what should have been done years ago - the systematic destruction of the Russian Fascist Party and its thugs.\n\nNow is the time - we can capitalize on their squabbling, destroy the Party, and recover the territory that we worked so hard to conquer when the Union collapsed. The Bolsheviks couldn't destroy us, and neither could the fascist betrayal. Now that we're able, we can finally display the strength and endurance of the true White Movement!"

 WCH_Western_defence_scheme:0 "Western Defence Scheme: Chita"
 WCH_Western_defence_scheme_desc:0 "The city of Chita, over four decades ago, was the capital of the Transbaikal Cossack Host, where Ataman Semyonov had made his last stand as the final hope for defeating Bolshevism in the Far East. Now, it is once again our hope for restoring the Tsar to his rightful place in the nation, and the Army must take careful steps to defend its holdings.\n\nThe provisional capital of the monarchy is situated dangerously close to the frontier where our control ends. We have no other choice but to protect it, and thus the High Command has suggested the construction of fortifications and the design of new plans to ensure Chita will not fall. West and north of the city, additional garrisons will be placed and new defensive lines will be formed. As our headquarters, it is the first place where our overhaul of defenses will begin."

 WCH_western_defence_scheme2:0 "Western Defense Scheme: Ulety"
 WCH_western_defence_scheme2_desc:0 "If one was to follow the road leading out of Chita and heading southwest, just before they cross into communist-held lands, they would come across the small settlement of Ulety. Initially nothing more than a normal village, Ulety earned the attention of the Tsarist generals as the final outpost controlled by them in the west. A small military base has been built, where soldiers guard the principal road before it enters hostile territory.\n\nAs part of the "Western Defense Scheme" endorsed by most of the Tsar's generals and approved by His Majesty, Ulety will be reinforced, as everyone understands that it is a crucial choke point for any invader. By building a new, larger outpost there, we can help ensure the safety of our warlord state and hopefully stall any possible enemy from the west before they reach Chita."

 WCH_eastern_defense_scheme:0 "Eastern Defense Scheme: Srednyaya Olekma"
 WCH_eastern_defense_scheme_desc:0 "On the bank of the river Olyokma, as it enters Transbaikal, rests the small town of Srednyaya Olekma, which could be considered our greatest base in the northeast. It has proven crucial in maintaining a line of defense against Rodzaevsky's fascists and the Aldan clique, and continues to be a checkpoint the Tsarist Army uses to exert its authority in the northeast, as well as stop occasional raids by hostile warlords or simple bandit groups.\n\nA reinforcement will be required if we look to expand into the fascist-held lands and secure our flank to the north at the same time. As it is the only town we hold in the region, it must become a stronghold against any army."

 WCH_eastern_defense_scheme2:0 "Eastern Defense Scheme: Tupik"
 WCH_eastern_defense_scheme2_desc:0 "South of the city of Srednyaya Olekma, where we last focused our efforts on backing up the garrison, Tupik is yet another village saved by anarchy or oppression by the arrival of the White Army. Since we prepare for the very real possibility of war with Rodzaevsky, known as the "Vozhd" of Amur, the Eastern Defense Scheme has begun, and Tupik is a key part of that. By significantly reinforcing the settlement, we can end the constant raids in its surroundings, and build yet another strong defensive point near the frontier.\n\nThe situation in Tupik is considered different by many in the government, though, as the village is tiny and there are no pre-existing military installations there. Despite that, it is judged as crucial in forming a line in the east, and the Tsar's most trusted generals believe building up Tupik will be an easy process."

 WCH_eastern_defence_scheme3:0 "Eastern Defense Scheme: Amazar"
 WCH_eastern_defence_scheme3_desc:0 "The final outpost we must fortify and perhaps the most important, seeing as we are heading into conflict with the fascists to our east, is the town of Amazar.\n\nThe Trans-Siberian Railway, although often damaged, rebuilt and destroyed in the last years, has still remained a vital artery to the lands beyond the Urals, connecting city after city and allowing the transport of people and supplies across its length. Amazar has had the luck to not only be included in the dozens of towns the railway passes through, but also just barely escape the grip of Rodzaevsky.\n\nAs both an important railway junction and the last camp to the east, we must take great care in protecting the town. Reinforcements will be called to act as garrisons, and reconnaissance units will be formed there as well. Soon, they might prove surprisingly useful."

Однако это не мешает ему быть опасным. Слухи с востока указывают на проводимые серии чисток, что равнозначно случайным убийствам на улицах и публичному повешению "несогласных". Родзаевский традиционно считался невероятно жестоким, но его недавние действия доказали, что он явно не в себе и действует далеко за пределами цивилизованности. Этому варварству и преступлениям, которые он совершил против русского народа, должен быть положен конец - и чем скорее, тем лучше. Таким образом, мы должны подготовиться к тому, чтобы пойти на бандита и восстановить порядок под истинными Наследниками Харбина. Конечно, особого сопротивления не будет.

Несмотря на их жестокость и восхищение немецкой системой, Родзаевский управлял сильной пропагандистской машиной. Партийные образы и символика были повсюду - очевидно, безумный "Вождь" хотел подражать самому Гитлеру. От свастики до больших знамен и антиеврейской пропаганды, бывшая столица РФП Зея была полна партийной символики. Но этого не может не быть. Михаил метко предложил "опрокинуть пьедестал" - процесс, направленный на уничтожение пропаганды РФП и обучение людей тому, что они больше не живут в условиях террора.

Хотя они не совсем довольны тем, что мы свергли их "золотого мальчика", японцы не более чем прагматики. Они знают, что наша администрация была бы гораздо предпочтительнее возрождающегося

Этот, по крайней мере, достаточно умен, чтобы знать, как приспособиться к представленной ему ситуации, и это делает его бесконечно более опасным, чем жесткий идеолог, живущий в Зее. Ходят слухи, что Матковский ищет иностранного признания и помощи, доходя даже до позициониования себя как умеренного претендента на Дальнем Востоке. Нельзя допустить, чтобы так продолжалось и дальше - ибо сейчас спрос на иностранную помощь означает, что даже самая незначительная сумма может стать переломным моментом в битве между Наследниками Харбина. Мы должны действовать быстро, и даже если это приведет к перенапряжению наших Вооруженных сил, мы должны попытаться покончить с режимом Матковского до того, как он стабилизируется.

Обещая амнистию тем, кто знает расположение этих тайников, мы можем заставить их привести нас к ним и выкопать их - подобно тому, как виновные убийцы приводят власти туда, где они прячут тела.

These emigres exist worldwide, with significant populations in Europe, Harbin, and the Americas.\n\nWith our diplomatic situation stabilized a little bit, it's time to appeal to these emigres.

Now that we've established ourselves in the Far East and proven to these once-cynical emigres that we're here to stay, only the most traitorous would think not to join us, and bring with them all of the industrial expertise they've cultivated over the years."

With these new emigres, especially those from the United States and England, bring with them their academic backgrounds and highly educated children - this steady stream of men and women from the more learned parts of the world will serve to increase our ability to educate the next generation and help create a real educated base for our Russia."

Mikhail was born in France and spent his life just about everywhere but Russia. When he was kidnapped and brought to the city of Chita as a prisoner in all but name, he was forced to read speeches phonetically, frequently not even aware of what he was saying.

However, Volkogonov and Mikhailov have warned of extremes; the new administration must walk a very delicate tightrope to ensure that the actions they take to secure their rule does not demonize them to the people they are humoring."

The first is to begin raising a new generation of officers to be trained and disciplined in our way, molded to our exact image. The second method, perhaps more practical, would be to simply repurpose and conscript officers of our now-defeated rivals in the Far East and Central Siberia to assist in both leading troops and training new officers.

He had always trusted them; they were more logical and not as shackled to the distant past of the old Empire.\n\nAtaman Semyonov opened the meeting, delivering a speech on the latest developments. His hands shook, and his balance was unsteady, but his voice and eyes were crystal clear. One by one, the other generals stated their opinion and expressed their concerns. Mikhail mostly remained silent and only occasionally expressed his expected approval as the other generals expressed their opinions and concerns, his head full of thoughts of the life and wife that he had left behind in Australia.\n\nOnce the meeting was adjourned, and escorted by his personal bodyguards, Mikhail decided to walk the streets of Chita.

A popular figure in Chita, and a valuable ally of Tsar Mikhail, he has departed this world to join many predeceased comrades.\n\nBorn in the Transbaikal in 1890, Semyonov first distinguished himself in the old Tsar's Cossack legions during the Great War. When the Civil War began, he organized some of the first anti-Bolshevik revolutions in the Transbaikal and, with the help of both the Czechoslovak Legion and the Japanese, managed to seize both Chita and the surrounding regions. There he held out against the Soviets even as the rest of the White movement crumbled, before being forced to flee into Manchuria.\n\nDecades later, as a leader of the émigré community in Harbin, he became a leader of the Japanese-supported anti-Bolshevik front, and rose to become the indisputable chief of the military clique that crowned Michael Andreevich, taking the new Tsar to Chita upon his triumphant return to the city.\n\nAs per his wishes, the Ataman has been buried in his home village of Kuranzha. While it may be dangerously close to the frontier with the socialist revolutionaries, thousands of people, from peasants to generals, have visited to pay their respects. Even His Majesty has issued a statement, expressing their condolences. Semyonov may have left behind a troubled legacy for some, but all of Chita recognizes him as a strong and respected leader."

Currently held by the Tsarists, the pro-monarchy legacy of the Harbin movement, the city and its administration has requested of us a large degree of industrial aid in the form of factory support and spare machinery. We could agree to deal with them, theoretically, in exchange for some future favor, or we could simply reject the warlord rabble."

 WCH.4.desc:0 "A reply to our request has come through today, sent directly from the capital of Manchuria. The reply, dripping with formality barely contained the implications that the letter hid: the subsequent industrial aid that would be provided to the Tsarists in Chita would come at a cost, and the cost would be more than just money. The Manchurians and their Japanese masters frequently dealt in favors, something that our government has already accepted as a reality. On a long enough timeline, it seems likely that they will come knocking at our front door, asking to be repaid.\n\nHowever, in the meantime, it appears as if Manchuria, likely with the permission of the Japanese, have agreed to our proposal for industrial aid. This is a fantastic win for us - while it won't necessarily help us directly legitimize our government and provide political recognition, it will however allow us to bolster our petty industrial output and shore up our manufacturing. One of the best ways to ensure our victory over our rivals is to make sure that we can put more guns in our people's hands than they can, and that's just what we intend to do with this aid."

The response was a simple, single-paged letter politely declining the opportunity, but thanking the Tsarists for bringing the offer forward. The letter was promptly burned after it was reported to those who needed to know.\n\nWith the offer for industrial aid declined by the Manchurians - likely at the hands of their Japanese masters, we can expect that any further industrial development will have to be done directly by us, instead of being reliant on foreign aid. While this is certainly a setback, it's not one that's unrecoverable. That being said, there are plenty of ways for us to fund this industrial development even without the Manchurian's help. Increased taxes, the use of the military for building, and the melding of private and governmental sectors will all be useful for just that. In the meantime, while our foreign affairs office licks their wounds, we can go ahead and draw up a number of proposals for domestic industrial development."

The rest of Russia was going to hell, but as far as Kiril was concerned, this place was paradise on earth. Or at least it was, until Kiril spotted a pillar of black smoke rising from the tree line. Looking more closely, he thought he saw distant trees beginning to tumble down and flocks of birds frantically flying away. "What the hell?!" Kiril exclaimed, throwing down his rod as he ran off to investigate.\n\nWhen Kiril finally arrived at the scene, it was worse than he feared. Scores of workers in hardhats were in the process of chopping down trees by the dozens, and large construction vehicles were recklessly tearing up the ground. In the midst of all this, a foreman was directing the workers. Kiril clenched his fists as he angrily approached the foreman, unconcerned with the notion that he may be trespassing. The foreman, a grizzled, older man like Kiril, turned to face the strange man approaching him from the forest. "Who are you? What the hell do you want?"\n\n"I'm Kiril. I live back that way, and I want to know why you're tearing down my forest!" The foreman chuckled mockingly in response. "Your forest? This ain't your property, pal, we checked." Kiril was visibly unsatisfied with this answer. "This is where I come to hunt. I survive off this land! Who gave you the right to come and rip it all apart?!" The foreman sighed. "Look, we're with the Imperial Development Company. The government said we were to clear space for construction, so take it up with them and stop wasting my time!" The foreman turned away from Kiril, and he took this as his queue to leave. Kiril promptly retreated in a huff, and knew that he would be spending much of his night writing angry letters."

They're experienced fighters, and could be a real problem for our soldiers."\n\nAt the general's words, which seemed to imply conflict was about to begin, Mikhail couldn't help but begin to worry. Was war really coming so soon?\n\nA second distinctive voice, that of Boris Shepunov, the Army's Chief of Staff, spoke next. "I disagree, Leonid. Mercenaries want to fight bandits, not real armies. When they see our soldiers, they'll scatter to the wind, and leave the fascists to their fate. And that rabble won't stand a chance against our forces!"\n\nMikhail felt his heart sink. His suspicions were correct, and regardless of what he might want, his little realm was going to war. He tried not to think about all the ways it could very poorly for him. Trying so hard, in fact, that he accidentally pushed the door open.\n\n"That's all well and good," said a third figure, that of General Vladimir Abramov, "but we still have no plans for the occupation of these territories.

He began smoking more to help calm his nerves, but couldn't shake the knowledge that he might not live to see another month. Taking a long drag, and hearing footsteps as he did so, Fedorovich raised his head and saw his squad leader.\n\n"Good morning, corporal," the sergeant said. "Got a light?" Fedorovich nodded, lighting the cigarette as asked. The sergeant looked to the east as he took a drag, past the small creek that had substituted as a border marker and towards the distant mountains. He gestured to Fedorovich. "Over that river lies a land filled with hordes of angry fascists." Fedorovich remained silent as he followed the sergeant's gaze. "I'm not going to lie, corporal, it's going to be rough. They're going to throw everything they've got at us, and we're going to take losses. There's no avoiding it, so prepare yourself while you still can, and if the time comes, make sure you take as many fascists down with you as possible."\n\nWith that, the sergeant discarded the cigarette, gave the mountains one last look, and made his way back towards the rest of the men.

"Everything I did, I did for Russia. You can call me a monster, but soon the people will realize that only monsters have the strength to save this country. Perhaps if I had killed that decrepit bastard Semyonov and the rest of those forgotten relics back in Harbin when I had the chance, we'd find ourselves in a very different situation, yes?" The demagogue managed a pained, wheezing chuckle and stood as straight as he was able. "Go on then, make your weak Tsar proud and shoot me already."\n\nA flurry of rifle fire aptly punctuated Rodzaevsky's mocking final words, and the former fascist leader fell to his knees before pitching face-first into the blood-stained snow.

It had to belong to a soldier - no civilian in Zeya would stop another on the street so casually. Slowly turning around, her heart sank as her suspicions were confirmed. A young Tsarist soldier stood there, awaiting an answer. Though the uniform was different, the gun slung over his shoulder had become synonymous with oppression and abuse under the fascist regime, and she mentally prepared herself for what was to come.\n\n"Apologies, ma'am, but I saw your bag and was wondering if you knew where I could find the grocer."

Have you learned nothing? The people of Russia will never accept a reactionary monarch.

"It could be worse, I suppose. Most days they don't even let me leave this house."\n\nMikhailov's pace slowed. "There are many things in this land that simply do not make sense, Majesty. The military holds even more influence than you think." Mikhailov's pace slowed to a stop, and Mikhail watched with concern as the minister cast his own nervous glance around. "Ah, I fear I may have said too much, my Tsar. I should leave before I am missed. We should speak again soon, preferably under less conspicuous circumstances."\n\nStanding alone once again in his gardens, the troubled Tsar was more confused than ever."

 WCH.23.desc:0 ""Tell me, Your Majesty," Ivan Mikhailov asked, dipping a spoon into his soup, "what was Australia like? You've hardly ever spoken about it."\n\n"Do you want to know the truth, Mikhailov?" The Tsar's tone was much more aggressive and authoritative than usual, and it took Mikhailov by surprise. "Australia was a paradise in comparison. I hate this place, Ivan. And you know what the worst part about it is? I can't leave. No matter how hard I try, there's no way out."\n\nMikhailov was stunned, the spoon slipping from his hand. "Y-your Majesty, I..."\n\n"Enough!" Mikhail roared. "I'm sick of pretending everything is fine, because it isn't. I can't even write letters to my family, did you know that? The other day I learned my secretary was delivering all my mail to Shepunov! Don't you get it?! I'm being held hostage in a country where everyone is spying on me, it's too cold, and I can't even properly speak the language!" Mikhailov was silent, his mouth agape. It was as if, for a few moments, the Tsar had become a completely different person. After a moment, Mikrail calmed. "I... I'm terribly sorry," he said. "That was rather undignified of me."\n\n"No, Your Majesty. You speak the truth. It is a sad state of affairs when even Russia's holy sovereign is nothing more than a slave to the whims of his army. You are the Tsar, the Emperor of all the Russias. The military likes to pretend that means nothing, but they have forgotten their place. You have a god-given destiny to lead, and they have a duty to follow in your wake." A long pause followed. "Perhaps it is not Russia you hate, my liege, but those who have selfishly taken advantage of her glorious legacy. Your legacy."\n\nThe Tsar looked distant, his mind alive with powerful thoughts. "Perhaps.""

He had known the moment the reports of the collapse of the Red Army's positions outside Irkutsk had arrived. The White Army had entered soon after.\n\nThe following days had been spent in a cell, one of his own, while the decisions on his fate were made, far above and away from his current position. It had taken far longer than he thought - the product, no doubt, of the confused and inefficient nature of the White-led government that had been once reported by the NKVD. But there was, in truth, only one possible choice. And it had finally been made.\n\nWhen the door opened, Yagoda stood. He had resolved to meet his end in as dignified a fashion as possible, not like the so many supposedly strong men he had seen collapse into primal terror when their end approached. He was gripped strongly all the same, and was led through the underground passages and up the stairs, finally emerging in the building's courtyard where a stanchion had been erected in front of one wall. In front of it stood a large party of soldiers and officers, waiting for his placement.\n\nToo many people, Yagoda thought. There was a reason he had always ordered men shot in a dark basement - it prevented people from knowing just what had happened, which therefore prevented any attribution of martyrdom. The knowledge that his name would endure long past this moment was small comfort. But it was still comfort, of a sort.\n\nIn his last moments, as he was fastened to the post, Yagoda felt something he had never felt before. Not fear, but apprehension. Apprehension for what came next. He wondered if all men in such a position felt the same.\n\nAnd then the command was given, and Yagoda felt no more."

 WCH.25.desc:0 "In their attempt to unify the Far East, the White Army had expected, and trained, to fight both communists and fascists. They had not expected, or trained, to fight religious extremists from the north.\n\nBut fight them they had. Defeated them, they had. Even through defections in their own ranks, peasant rebellions behind the lines, and truly difficult territory, they had defeated the fanatics in the field. Further, upon capturing Omolon, they had also captured their leader, the enigmatic priest Alexander Men.\n\nAt the decision of the central government, Men had been placed on trial, and the entire process had proven far more difficult than anticipated. Because Men would not speak. Not a single word. Through pretrial motions, opening statements, evidence presentation, cross-examination, and the like, he had remained entirely silent.\n\nThis was causing problems for the state as a whole. The sentiments that Men had spoken to in so much of the rural population still existed, and without any response from him, the trial increasingly looked like little more than one for show. Were he to be found guilty, as had been intended, and given appropriate punishment, he would undoubtedly be considered by many as a martyr. And that could not be permitted if stability was to be preserved.\n\nTherefore, the decision had been made and conveyed by proper means. Men was to be found guilty on some, but not all charges, and given a lengthy prison sentence. There would be unrest, but in time and as the government solidified internal control, people would forget about the priest rotting, silently if desired, in his cell.\n\nAnd at that point, the sentence could easily be extended indefinitely. Or restored to that as originally intended."

 WCH.30.desc:0 ""You asked to see me, sir?" General Shepunov asked, standing face-to-face with his superior in the doorway. The old Ataman, who leaned on an intricately designed cane, looked as though he had one foot in the grave. The years had clearly not been kind to the man who once defied the Red behemoth so many years ago.\n\n"Indeed. Please, come in and take a seat." Ataman Semyonov said weakly, his voice almost a whisper. Shepunov did as he said and took position on a dusty, vintage sofa by the fireplace. The old man took longer, bones audibly creaking as he sat across from his protege. "Boris, I'll get right to the point. I don't have nearly as much time to waste on platitudes these days." Semyonov ended off with a chuckle which quickly transformed into a messy cough.\n\n"That makes two of us, Grigoriy. Just tell me what you need of me."\n\n"Boris, my time here is running out. It shames me deeply that I won't be able to see Russia cleansed of the red menace in my lifetime, but perhaps I can rest more peacefully knowing that the struggle will continue without me." Semyonov leaned forward. "When the time comes, I want you to take my place."\n\nShepunov was speechless. He had long followed in Semyonov's footsteps, but to take his place? "Grigoriy, I would be honored, but, are you absolutely sure that I'm the one you want?"\n\n"I've had decades to think it over, Boris. Nobody truly understands what this movement means like you and I do. If anyone can bring order back to our sacred motherland, it is you."

And yet he had been a known quality.\n\nMikhail had known where he stood. He could not yet say the same of Semyonov's replacement, both as interim Prime Minister and as Commander-in-Chief of the military as a whole, Boris Shepunov. He knew of the general of course, Semyonov's long-serving protegé, and had interacted with him before, but never in such a political capacity.\n\nShepunov had spoken grandly at Semyonov's funeral, eulogizing the man and proclaiming his greatness, no-doubt already knowing that he would be stepping forward to fill the power vacuum. Mikhail was sure that he had equally grand plans. The White Army always did, especially when they involved him.\n\nWhich was why, on this very day when he formally 'invited' Shepunov to take control over the government, he had to fight hard to keep his expression neutral. The man's entire demeanor was entirely different. He walked differently. Spoke differently. His eyes even seemed to have, if possible, gotten even colder than he had remembered.\n\nAs Shepunov thanked him for his 'confidence' and turned to leave, no doubt to execute whatever plans he had already made, Mikhail could no longer prevent a grimace from crossing his face.\n\nWhat was to come?

I shall be taking on all other duties handled by my predecessor, as well. Rest assured that-"\n\n"That's rather swell, Commander Shepunov, but I've been meaning to ask you something for a while now."\n\n"Yes, my Tsar?" Shepunov asked, his face twitching ever so slightly. He despised being interrupted, especially by someone like the human weasel sitting in front of him.\n\n"I was, erm, wondering, hypothetically, what if I didn't, uh, want to stay here? In Russia, I mean."\n\n"What are you saying? You're the Tsar, you cannot leave." Shepunov raised an eyebrow.\n\n"I don't like it here, Shepunov. Please, if you would-"\n\n"Let's make one thing perfectly clear, 'Majesty'. You are going to be staying here in Russia for as long as that crown rests on your head, and I would suggest, strongly, to put to bed any thoughts of abandoning your destiny."

He, the son of a peasant, specifically selected out of thousands - no, tens of thousands - to be a member of the Imperial Guard! Yeltsov, a man who mere years ago had been a private, eating bottom barrel food not fit for a rat, was now the man who would guard his Tsar with his life.\n\nThen, suddenly, the Tsar was there, stepping out on the top of the Palace's tall steps. A newfound energy possessed him, and he wanted to, desperately, yell his loyalty to the man who would be Tsar of all Russia.\n\n"Subjects," began the Tsar, his voice clearly heard by all men in attendance. "I am..."\n\nFor a couple of seconds, there was silence where inspiring words should have been. "...here to say that..."\n\nYeltsov had an instinctual need to see the face of his fellow guards, but knew better than to do that in front of the Tsar. But still, he couldn't be the only one who find this strange.\n\nThe 'speech', if you could call it that, continued for another five minutes, although based off the actual content, Yeltsov guessed it would have been a minute at the most. Occasionally, the Tsar stumbled over his words before correcting himself, clearly embarrassed.\n\nBut the gist was obvious: he, Yeltsov, was a member of the Imperial Guard, tasked with protecting the Emperor with his life.

The neighboring White Army formations could fight well enough, of course, but they rarely attempted special maneuvers. So as the sounds of galloping horses began echoing through the small valley that the outpost rested in, they were at first confused. They then realized, far too late, that the sounds were both too loud, and coming from the wrong direction.\n\nWhen the contingent of White Army cavalry broke out of the treeline, immediately overrunning the too-close pickets and galloping towards the outpost at breakneck speed, the RFP officers tried in vain to prepare a defense. But there just wasn't enough time.\n\nThose few troopers already on duty could not believe their eyes. The cavalry advanced, despite their great speed, in perfect echelon, with no subunits becoming separated or fragmented. As they approached the outpost's perimeter, they expertly divided, with the main force leaping over the poorly-maintained wire obstacles and smaller ones circling around both to flank and prevent escape.\n\nThe result was carnage. Utterly overwhelmed, the cavalrymen slaughtered the RFP, either where they stood, or as they tried to flee in terror from this unexpectedly proficient enemy. When it was all over, both the outpost itself and the intelligence contained within had been secured for minimal casualties.\n\nWhen the cavalry departed back westwards, they burned the outpost to the ground, sending the message that the White Army was no longer as ill-disciplined as the RFP itself often was. It was a real, professional force, with tactics to match.\n\nAs they intended to soon prove in increasing fashion."

Or, just as often, not making them, and arriving anyway. This particular meeting was of the latter variety.\n\nThe general, one of those closest to Semyonov's inner circle, had walked right past his deputies and secretaries, entering Mikhailov's office and closing the door behind him. From his demeanor Mikhailov could tell that, whatever the man wanted, it would not be something he himself would be pleased to grant. And that he would not have a choice besides.\n\nThe request, as he expected, was polite. The military would be 'requesting' further funds to be diverted towards their own initiatives in the upcoming budget. In order to ensure the defense of the state and of the Tsar, of course. The authorization for that diversion to be included was placed in front of him a moment later, with all of the specific amounts and diversions meticulously identified. All it needed was his signature on the bottom line.\n\nUnder the general's stare, Mikhailov knew he would, and did, sign the document. The general whisked it away a moment later, leaving without further word. As the door closed behind the man once again, Mikhailov once again felt the deep frustration that he had grown used to begin to build within him.\n\nThis time, however, it was even stronger than usual. The military had always ensured its own primacy in the Principality's budget. But lately their 'requests' had grown, in both frequency and amount. Very soon, Mikhailov knew, and if the trend continued, he was not sure where the civil government would find funds for projects of any size.\n\nHe also was not sure if the military cared."

When it became further known that the Tsar himself was to open it, they were intrigued, and came out in droves to witness the occasion.\n\nAnd so, when Mikhail did arrive, it was to face a crowd much, much larger than had been anticipated. He wasn't alone, of course. Both Minister of Finance Mikhailov and Mayor Sobchak were present as well, giving their own speeches before his own, but as they spoke his anxiety only increased.\n\nHe might not have wanted to be in Chita in the first place, the figurehead Tsar of a formerly-stateless army, but as long as he was he was determined to put his best foot forward. The only problem, at least as far as speeches were concerned, was his Russian. Or, rather, his lack of any considerable experience at speaking it.\n\nAs Mikhail took to the podium, to what was to him an unexpectedly enthusiastic cheer, he withdrew his speech and began to speak, nervously at first, but with increasing confidence. Until he realized he had missed a word. And then a second one. And then a third. In a sudden panic, it was as if he had forgotten Russian entirely.\n\nThankfully, Mayor Sobchak seemed to have noticed his monarch's distress. Intervening, Sobchak thanked Mikhail for taking the time to address his subjects and, in doing so, allowed him an opportunity to step off of the stage.\n\nAs Mikhail left, personally quite relieved, he was again surprised by the cheers that followed him.

Advancing past their former defensive line, the unit soon encountered what they at first thought, owing to the wire fence and observation towers, to be a fortified supply depot. The towers abandoned, a small group of volunteers breached the main gate, under close supervision. Shortly thereafter, they returned, their faces white. The rest of the unit soon discovered why.\n\nThe compound was no supply depot. It was, rather, a camp for those that Rodzaevsky's regime had considered undesirables of any sort. Politically, socially, ethnically, religiously, or for any reason at all. The camp's former guards had deserted alongside their compatriots, but they had left their prisoners behind.\n\nThe shells that moved were more skeleton than human, walking around in a daze, and seeming not even to recognize their liberators as men at all. More than one had fled in primal terror at seeing a uniform, regardless of who it belonged to. Two of them died shortly after gorging themselves on food the soldiers had provided, before the unit's medical officers imposed strict rationing.\n\nBut the worst came when a young corporal found the graves, of such scale that, despite their attempts, the fascists had been unable to properly conceal them. Overcome, the corporal found himself vacating the contents of his stomach before swooning, and taking much effort to revive.\n\nThe unit's commander hastily dispatched messages demanding relief.

The regime that controlled the port of Magadan was being pressured by its enemies, and had called for fighters from abroad. Accepting the incentive payment, Ernesto found himself stepping off a boat in that port only several weeks later, to a land very different from those he had been in before.\n\nTruthfully, he did not like the people he worked for, but they paid well and on time, and that was enough.

After securing his last paycheck, of course.\n\nAt first Ernesto had thought himself in trouble, but then he heard the good news.

The procedure went on as planned, as the Emperor made his way down the row exchanging handshakes and salutes. He couldn't help but notice that these young men looked at him with a great deal of admiration, as though he were a figure of divine status. One of the officers he had come to couldn't have been older than twenty.\n\n"Hail, your Imperial Majesty. It is an honor to serve you." The young officer gave a gracious salute.\n\nMikhail sheepishly went in for a handshake. "No, no. The honor is all mine. I am truly grateful for your service." The Tsar gave a slight, nervous smile. He glanced back at Boris Shepunov, who was standing behind him. The old general had his arms crossed, and his impatient expression clearly indicated that he wanted Mikhail to pick up the pace.\n\nAs the inspection concluded and the royal entourage made its way back to their transportation, Mikhail passed by a sight that had caught his eye. A large bronze statue depicting a heroic cossack warrior on horseback was prominently displayed out front of the army base. Mikhail stopped briefly to examine the bronze figure, captivated by the pose of the warrior.

This group mostly consists of wealthy aristocrats and businessmen, and are keen to utilize the Committee to expand their business interests in the empire. Also among this group are close political allies and confidants of Tsar Mikhail II, and control over the Committee would surely mean an expansion of the crown's influence.\n\nOn the other hand, politicians and military men allied to the White Army also seek to bring the IGC under their control. The majority of these men have connections to the White Army's general staff, and by extension, Army Chief of Staff Boris Shepunov.

Opportunistic statesmen circle like vultures, and rally around Tsar Mikhail, the one man they believe can spearhead their intentions of breaking the tight stranglehold the White Army has over the state.\n\nWith the support of a clique of young officers and the backing of Ivan Mikhailov, Mikhail conspires to seize control over the government and reaffirm his status as the absolute authority of the Russian state in both name and intent.

While they still do not have conclusive evidence that the Tsar is conspiring against them, they are at the very least suspicious enough to prepare for preemptive action against potential dissidents.

"Surrender and stand down! That is an order!" There was no response, either in word or action, and Shepunov sighed in frustration. He had hoped that the loyalists would come peacefully, and surrender the Tsar without bloodshed, but it was not to be, and now many of them would have to die. He turned to his subordinate. "General Volkogonov, you may begin."\n\nVolkogonov nodded and picked up his radio. "All units!" he commanded, "commence operation on my order!" With one final nod from Shepunov, Vinogradov gave the command. "Fire!" The soldiers, having prepared themselves in predetermined positions, obeyed, and within moments began pouring fire into the Tsar's residence.\n\nRifles and machine guns raked the windows and doors as the cannons of the armoured carriers blew holes in the walls, reducing much of the first storey to rubble. Return fire was sporadic and inaccurate, and before long, ceased entirely. A short while later, Volkogonov's soldiers stopped firing as well.\n\nExamining the scene, Volkogonov's chest tightened. He could see the twisted and mangled bodies of the Honor Guard, until only a few moments before comrades like any other, scattered amid the rubble, and those that were still alive would be crippled for life. Full of shame, but not wanting to show it to anyone, least of all Shepunov, Volkogonov turned away as his men advanced on the residence with weapons raised."

Only a token force of Imperial Honor Guard and a few conscientious young officers stood between him and those who had conspired against the state. The old general prepared to make his intentions known.\n\n"Attention, all of those who serve the Tsar! We are here only to execute the will of the Russian state! Mikhail Andreevich has thrown his lot in with treasonous elements, and has forsaken his holy vows to protect Russia and her people. Stand down at once!" The Tsar's loyalists did not budge. Shepunov could not take their defiance any longer. "Enough of this farce. General Volkogonov, order your men to attack. This ends today."\n\n"No. I'm afraid I can't do that, sir."\n\n"What the fuck-" Turning to face his subordinate, he was met instead with the barrel of a gun. Volkogonov had his sidearm pointed directly at his face. "What... What the hell do you think you're doing, General?!" Shepunov's voice, usually stern and decisive, now bore a rarely-seen panic.\n\n"Boris Shepunov, in the name of His Imperial Majesty, Mikhail II, I am placing you under arrest." Shepunov's world was turned upside down in only a few seconds. Volkogonov's soldiers had turned their sights inwards, and began violently detaining any units present who answered to Shepunov.\n\n"You too, Volkogonov? No... This can't be..." Words had finally failed him. The Prime Minister and Commander of the White Army, formerly the most powerful man in the Empire, felt his knees give out as soldiers cuffed his hands. Almost as soon as it had begun, his iron-clad reign had come to an end."

From this elevated position, he could see clearly the results of the day's labor. Vast ranges of landscape, deprived of trees as far as his eyes could see. In their place were stumps much like the one he was now using as a seat.\n\nHere he was, once a son of the Siberian wilderness and her natural bounties, now doing the bidding of the very men he once tried to resist. Although the pay was very good, Kiril still wondered if it was worth selling his soul and helping them to destroy forests similar to the one he once called home.\n\nAs Kiril lit a cigarette, his mind continued to wander. Siberia was a vast land, but even the seemingly endless forests of a land like this were finite in the grand scheme of things. The Imperial Development Company tore into the wilderness like a pack of wolves, ripping down forests and transforming wide tracts of wilderness into featureless plains of grass. Kiril wondered if, in the future, there would even be any forests left once the IDC was done?\n\nHe had been born and raised a man of the wilds, living off the land and appreciating what nature had to offer. Civilization was overrated as far as Kiril was concerned, and he hoped that more people would come to appreciate its beauty. The problem with this, however, was that the pay was no good. In the end, even a wild beast like Kiril was tempted by the IDC's offer of wealth.\n\nFar in the future, would Kiril's children be able to experience the same kind of life that he once did? Putting out his cigarette, Kiril ceased his thoughts and headed off to end his shift for the day."

However, as was routine in a land as dysfunctional as Russia, the reality was far more complicated than that.\n\nThe White Army must've had over a thousand troops on the field already, with plenty more on the way. Volkgonov's contingent made up a rather small portion of those present, and he found himself almost as outnumbered as the poor souls trying in vain to protect their doomed Tsar. As Boris Shepunov shouted for the Tsar's bodyguards to surrender, Volkogonov's mind drifted into dark places he would've rather avoided. Was his decision to side with Mikhail a wise one after all? What would happen if he tried to disarm his own superior with odds as hopeless as this?\n\nThe voice of his superior broke Volkogonov's introspection. "General Volkogonov, I want your men to move in. I've spent too long trying to haggle with these fools. Time to wrap this shitshow up." The general was caught like a deer in headlights. What would he say? Was this his moment? To betray the Tsar would be most dishonorable, but the alternative would surely spell his doom...\n\n"General? Have you not heard me? Get your men in gear!" Volkogonov gulped nervously. It was going to be now or never. No matter what decision he had made today, somebody was going to consider him a traitor. The only difference would be whether or not he'd survive after the fact.\n\n"Y-yes sir. All units, prepare to advance!" With that, the troops of the White Army descended upon the Tsar's residence.

They know what we're up to and they have the building surrounded! If only I hadn't accepted that bloody invitation, I wouldn't be in this mess to begin with!" Mikhail's hysterical shouting only caused an inescapable feedback loop of panic amongst the two. A sudden burst of small arms fire from outside interrupted their musings, followed in short order by an ear shattering explosion that shook the entire building. Mikhail let out a rather unflattering scream as a stray bullet shattered the window he was crouched by. The two men went prone to the floor, covering their heads as the symphony of gunfire reached its crescendo.\n\nAfter what felt like hours, the guns abruptly fell silent. The heavy breathing of both Mikhail and Mikhailov were now the only sound that remained. Mikhailov was the first to rise, peeking out the shattered window to see what had happened. No luck. It was getting dark, and the smoke emitted from the fighting made it hard for the old man to see.\n\n"What's happened? Did we win?" Mikhail asked nervously, still flat on the ground.

Vladimir was hand-picked by Boris Shepunov personally to head the White delegation to Tokyo. Although the general would never dare to question his superior's orders, there was one small hang up that he had with the idea: Abramov was a military man, and had no diplomatic experience whatsoever.\n\nHe wondered why Shepunov didn't just get the Foreign Ministry to handle it instead, but it was too late to do anything about it now. The Japanese were before him, expecting Abramov to be the face of the new Russian diplomatic mission. He knew the future of Russo-Japanese relations may hinge on the success or failure of this meeting.\n\n"In short, His Imperial Majesty wishes to look past any historical transgressions and promote a great renewal in Russo-Japanese relations. Rest assured, we approach as friends and equals." Abramov's statement sounded painfully rehearsed, and he hoped that fact was lost on the Japanese.\n\nHis Japanese counterpart turned to speak to one of his subordinates in a language the Russian delegation did not understand. The diplomat then turned back to Abramov with an unconvincing smile on his face. "Equals, you say? What an interesting perspective, to say the least.

In the past, the White Army's troops were brigands in uniform, no better than the barbarous raiders he had seen several decades ago when he served under Ataman Semyonov.\n\nWhat he saw instead, was quite different. The troops marched in lockstep, their eyes focused upon their Tsar and their arms in salute. Their uniforms were impeccably well-maintained, and slung over their shoulders were the latest in small arms designs. Even an old White like Shepunov couldn't help but be impressed by the gallant figure the soldiers below had presented.\n\nAs the foot soldiers passed, and the famed Cossack riders came into view, Shepunov couldn't help but get emotional. After so many years, this was the army he had been trying to build. Not a ragtag collection of mounted raiders and militias, but a professional force ready to take on the world if it came to that.\n\n"Vladimir, I never thought I'd see the day when the White Army would resemble an actual military. This is simply incredible..." Shepunov's eyes were still on the riders as he spoke to General Abramov, who stood next to him.\n\nMikhail II, however, was the only man present who couldn't care less.

That is not to say, however, that things were any less strange.\n\nAs she made her way home for the day, Sofiya noticed a small group of people gathered around the sidewalk in front of her. Their attention appeared to be focused on something attached to the side of a building. Whatever it was, it had caused quite a stir. As she drew closer, she could hear the people mumbling amongst themselves. Finally, she was able to see what exactly they were looking at.\n\nAttached to the wall was a large propaganda poster, clearly meant to advertise service in the White Army. Front and center was an idealized depiction of a fierce-looking soldier charging a two-headed dragon with his rifle in hand. The dragon was clearly an evil creature, with one head colored red and the other a deep black. Wrapped in the beast's tail was a pole bearing the tattered tricolor of Russia. Captioned in bold letters were the words "Join the White Army, and deliver holy Russia from the clutches of radicalism!". The symbolism was not lost on anyone.\n\nSofiya could not help feeling twinges of concern. While this poster was fairly benign, similarly militaristic designs would not look entirely out of place in the previous regime.

 WCH_regional.43.desc:0 "Placing the artillery shell on the assembly line, his hundredth of the day, Andrei sighed and, looking around to see if a warder was watching, stretched his aching back.\n\nA former fighter for Matkovsky's faction of the RFP, Andrei had been captured during the fall of Magadan. After a short time spent in a Tsarist prison camp, wondering as to his ultimate fate, he had suddenly been issued simple tools and sent to an iron mine near Chita. Long hours spent underground had driven him almost to the point of insanity, and nearly destroyed him physically besides.\n\nJust as suddenly, however, he had been ordered into a truck, and within short order had found himself in a munitions factory. Assembling and polishing artillery shells was hard work, but it was nothing compared to mining. Even if there were many more guards watching him now.\n\nHe supposed he couldn't blame them. Placing former enemies in proximity to high explosives would have given him pause as well. But they had nothing to worry about, at least not from those smart enough to properly understand their situation.\n\nEven if escape or sabotage was possible, there was nowhere to go, and Matkovsky was gone. As stressful as work in the factory was, it was a far sight better than that of the mine. The food and barracks were better as well. So Andrei would work, and work hard. One day, he knew, the Tsarists would have to let him go.\n\nUntil then, however, he would work. Finishing his stretch, he returned his attention to the production line. He had hundreds more shells to finish before the day's end."

The prospect of a White crackdown was never far from the minds of those assembled and each and every member of the underground had sworn oaths both to one another and to absolute secrecy. How, then, did the Okhrana know exactly where to find them? The door flew off the hinges as the Tsarist death squad stormed inside, the Sablinites scrambling for their weapons. Vasily, Katya, and Boris died in the first few seconds: soft lungs, hearts, and hard heads blooming like dripping roses in answer to the Tsar's bullets. An errant round tore through the portrait of Sablin that stood at the end of the table, the shattering of glass unheard in the rattle of gunfire. The Leninists fought back, firing wildly with pistols and cheap SMGs, crouching behind overturned tables. Others attempted to flee, the last thing they saw before running into the snow were the hollow and betrayed faces of their comrades, who loved them above all others.\n\nThe operation was a tremendous success. Every communist bandit was accounted for, either dead or in the tender clutches of the Okhrana. Blood dripped down onto the fallen portrait. If anyone had bothered to look, they might have thought Sablin was weeping blood."

He would have said more, but he was interrupted by the sight of a huge transport ship headed their way.\n\n"Get into position everybody, we've got a ship coming up", Maxim shouted as his vessel started speeding towards the ship, his blood suddenly pumping. His crew readied their guns on the edge of the ship when a thought tugged at the back of Maxim's head. Ships did not usually sail towards the pirates.\n\nBefore he could warn the crew to turn around, however, several bursts of heavy machine gun fire ripped through his ship and crew. An explosion of pink mist and wooden splinter saw Maxim dive into the water below. In his final moments, Maxim looked up to see the words imprinted on the ship holding the heavy machine gun about to fire upon him."

Your tenure as the mayor of Chita was nothing short of exemplary, and a fine example of statesmanship. We could use that kind of skill in the national government. What do you say, Sobchak?

The response was resounding, and vigorous. This was the first time Abdulov could feel that this pledge was genuine, rather than a formal necessity. They all had been taught to look up to the Tsar as the physical embodiment of Russia's will, rather than a weak puppet for ambitious career officers to exploit for power.\n\nAbulov smiled.

He had passed away peacefully in his sleep, a very different fate from the threat of public execution that once loomed over his head. A public funeral was held in Chita a few days after Mikhailov's passing, and almost the entire governing body of the Empire was in attendance. The first to speak before the attendees was Tsar Mikhail II, a man who had much to owe to Mikhailov.\n\nMikhail nervously looked to the crowd. He had no script; no plans for his speech, only grief that weighed heavily on his mind.\n\n"I did not know Mikhailov for long. When I first came to Russia, I assumed he was like all the others: a delusional old exile who only intended to keep me under lock and key. For years I had no reason to doubt this assumption, until one fateful day in my garden..." The Tsar's voice cracked. His eyes began to feel heavy and his lower lip began to tremble. "No, be strong." he whispered under his breath.\n\n"It was that day I learned that he was not like the rest. Mikhailov cared for me, and he cared for Russia. I owe so much to that man, that I could not possibly express it through words. I..." Mikhail clenched his teeth as he felt the tears welling behind his eyelids.

"You really thought that would work," he said softly, now beyond the need to perform, "didn't you?"\n\nMikhail returned the stare. "I had to do something, Boris. I couldn't just stand by any longer." He looked up towards the small barred window, set high in the wall. "Enjoy it while it lasts, because it won't. You've doomed Russia, you know."\n\nShepunov's mouth twitched in response as he shook his head. "That's where you're wrong. I've simply doomed you, Mikhail. Semyonov should have left you in Australia. Ruling was not something you ever had the capacity for. Not a garden there, not a city here, and most certainly not all of Russia." Shepunov raised a finger. "Russia needs decisive leaders, and the one time you tried to be one you couldn't even take down an old man like me." Unsure of how to respond, and hating himself for hearing at least some truth in Shepunov's words, Mikhail sat back on his cot in silence.\n\nAfter a long moment he spoke, his voice cold but firm. "Congratulations on your victory then, Regent. Now leave me be."\n\nShepunov bowed slightly. "As you wish, Mr. Andreevich."

The two recruits behind him awkwardly shuffled their feet.\n\n"But I haven't even broken even tonight, sir!" Sergei protested, forgetting for a moment that the men he spoke to were the law, at least for the foreseeable future. "I don't remember a curfew being announced, either."\n\nOne of the other soldiers stepped forward aggressively, knocking a cabbage off the cart. "He said pack it up." The sergeant shot his subordinate a glare before picking up the damaged cabbage, replacing it on the cart, and placing a few rubles on the rough wood in compensation.\n\n"My apologies," he began, "but please, go inside."\n\nRealizing he had gotten off easy, Sergei nodded and began packing his cart up as the soldiers Sighing, Sergei began packing it in for the night as the soldiers continued down the street.

Unfortunately, rather than the friend he hoped for, Dmitri found himself faced with the living reminder of his crimes - Boris Shepunov, the man himself.\n\nWith a grin, the Regent promptly invited himself into Dmitri's home.

A bag over his head stole his vision. Strong hands on his arms stole his freedom.\n\nDragged up the stairs and out of the cottage, Pavel felt fleeting joy at the feeling of sunlight on his skin, but knew as he was loaded into a truck that he would not see it again for a very long time.

The officer did not reply as Mikhail gave one last sigh and climbed the steps.\n\nSitting down beside a window, the former Tsar watched without interruption as the plane took off and the land he had ruled, at least in name, disappeared beneath the clouds.

From this moment onward, he was an emperor.\n\nThe bishop continued with the ceremony. "Most God fearing, absolute, and mighty Lord, Tsar of all the Russias, this visible and tangible adornment of thy head is an eloquent symbol that thou, as the head of the whole Russian people, art invisibly crowned by the King of kings, Christ, with a most ample blessing, seeing that He bestows upon thee entire authority over His people."\n\nThe bishop handed Nikita his scepter and orb and as he received them, moving towards the throne for the next part of the ceremony, he couldn't help but see Shepunov watching him from the front row of the cathedral, eyes narrowed and unblinking.

What would happen if Shepunov tired of him?\n\nHe had no answer, and sweeping those thoughts aside, he took solace in that, for now at least, he was the new face of the Russian monarchist movement.

One thing led to another, and I found myself being crowned as the Tsar of All Russia in the frozen wastes of Siberia.\n\nDespite their generous show of goodwill, these old whites merely wanted to use me as a puppet to fulfill their dreams of domination over Russia and her people.

"Go on, I wish to hear of your reasons."\n\n"Your Excellency, I disagree with this because making an army loyal to our country as well as the Tsar is what allowed for such people as Shepunov, believing themselves above their station in the name of 'protecting the people.' While I do believe that some excesses should be curbed, by in large, the army should be loyal to the Tsar and his will."\n\n"That is just nonsense," responded Volkogonov, his voice rising, "the reason people like Shepunov had such influence is because they had His Excellency as a figurehead, using him as another term for 'the nation' rather than their own personal interests. By combining them as one in the same, we can avoid that from ever happening again."\n\nSobchak laughed. "Irrational, such nonsense!"\n\n"Explain away, Mr. Sobchak, I would love to hear!"\n\n"Stop!" screamed Mikhail, slamming his hands on the table. "I will not hear of this. Sobchak, while I do find your reasons compelling, I find my own experiences have outweighed such positions. I will stand by Volkogonov 100 percent, and I expect you to go through with that plan. Understood?"\n\nSochak nodded. "I understand, Your Excellency.""

 WCH_superregional.18.desc:0 "Vaksberg was writing a report when an assistant barged in, his face colorless. "The Japanese," he says, trying his best to speak through labored breathes, "they are calling!"\n\nVaksberg quickly jumped from his seat, and, telling him to lead the way, followed the assistant down a hallway to a cable room, where a receiver was being handled by a young operator. Vaksberg quickly grabbed at it, and spoke "Hello, Boris Vaksberg, speaking as Head Chief of Japanese Relations, a part of the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Empire. Who is this?"\n\n"Ah, yes, this is Ota Daisuke, a member of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. This is a call of the upmost importance."\n\nVaksberg felt his skin crawl as he heard those words come through. Composing himself, he responded "Of what import, Mr. Daisuke?"\n\n"Well, Mr. Vaksberg, many in Tokyo, myself included, are aware of the change in leadership in Siberia, and are wondering if your nation's prior agreements are going to be enforced?"\n\nAh, Vaksberg thought, that's why they called. Always money and resources with the Japanese. Just another market, another sphere to make more money. "Ah, of course," began Vaksberg, "well, I am afraid to notify Tokyo that all former promises to the Japanese, including all debts, are hereby null and void, done without the consent of the Tsar of Russia."\n\n"I see." There was a silence for a couple of moments, which made Vaksberg feel like his legs were wobbly. "Well, Mr. Vaksberg, that is truly a shame. Truly. It is something that many in Tokyo will find a tragedy, and consequences will be steep for your nation and for her people."\n\nAnd with that, the phone went dead."

 WCH_superregional.19.desc:0 "Ever since the store had first opened in Krasnoyarsk, Galina had been a loyal customer. Operated by a zaibatsu subsidiary, it offered Japanese products not otherwise seen in Siberia, and she made sure to inspect their new arrivals every week.\n\nBut now, and very suddenly, it was gone. So focused on imagining what she might see, she had not even noticed until she had attempted to open the door. It was only when she realized it was locked, looked through the window, and saw workmen installing new displays, that she understood. Knocking on the door to draw their attention, she managed to draw their foreman over to speak to her.\n\nThe man confirmed her fears. The store, and the company that had operated it, were both gone for good. An educated fellow, he very patiently explained that the new policies of the Tsar's government had made it impossible for the zaibatsu to compete with the Imperial Corporations, including the one that had purchased the building. But, he assured her with a wide smile, the new owners intended to provide the exact same types of products, while making the state stronger at the same time. Only now, those products would be made in Siberia, rather than in the factories of Japan.\n\nGalina managed a weak smile, thanked the man, and left. She knew the old store would not be coming back. Not with the rhetoric she had been hearing, confirmed by the foreman. She also knew that the Siberian products were not likely to be as well-built or as diverse as the Japanese. But she would go to the new store, smile, and buy some of the items.\n\nShe had to be seen to support the initiative. And, who knew? Maybe some of the items would surprise her."

 WCH_superregional.21.desc:0 "In the dining room of the Tsar's palace, the three most powerful men in the country sat together at a table. However, it wasn't simply a pleasant meal. It was a meeting to determine the very future of the institutions of the Empire.\n\n"All due respect, Tsar Mikhail, we must proceed with democratic elections without delay. The people have waited long enough, and I fear the return of the protests." Volkogonov explained. His face was a little sad, but determined. He had long since decided not to let the brutality he had seen in response to the previous protests go on vain.\n\nMikhail nodded, considering this, before turning to Sobchak. "Do you have any wisdom to share yourself, Anatoly?" He asked, gesturing at Sobchak with his fork.\n\n"Certainly, Tsar Mikhail. I'm afraid I must wholeheartedly disagree with my associate here. What is an election with political parties, without political media, without even many people prepared to run?" Sobchak paused a moment after posing this rhetorical question, a small smile on his face that didn't quite reach his eyes. "Instead, we should have a civilian provisional government, to prepare the people for a modern democracy and solidify democratic institutions. Of course, ultimately, the choice is yours, my Tsar."\n\nSetting down his knife and fork, Mikhail thought very carefully for a few long moments. Ultimately, however, he came to a decision."

 WCH_superregional.23.desc:0 "The generals, almost as one, grumbled as they arrived at the military academy in Chita. They knew little about the reason why they had been summoned, other than it was because Prime Minister Shepunov had ordered it. And that was enough.\n\nEntering the building, they were directed to one of the larger classrooms, confusing them even further. It was only once they had sat down, and an officer young enough to be some of their grandsons entered, that they understood.\n\nThe Prime Minister greatly appreciated their loyalty and efforts in securing the power both of the state and the command structure, he said, but there was more to do. Campaigns had been won in spite, not because of, their strategies and methods of planning. This could, and would change. He, and others to come, were here to teach them new methods of warfare. Modern methods.\n\nThe response from the generals was immediate, and vigorous. They had been leading men since before the officer had been born. They had been fighting since the fall of the old Empire. What they knew could, and did, fill volumes of military texts. They needed no additional training or instruction from officers far too young to properly know, or respect, their betters.\n\nThe young officer listened to each of their arguments politely, and then offered his response: Prime Minister Shepunov disagreed.\n\nAnd so the generals sat, listened, and in time, learned."

 WCH_superregional.25.desc:0 "When he was informed that he would be returning to his factory, Fyodor had been extremely happy. That feeling remained, but had been significantly tempered.\n\nOne of the many refugees in Novosibirsk, Fyodor had spent months looking for work, so focused he was unaware of the dark clouds on the horizon. When war with the Tsarist regime broke out, he had actually been pleased. War meant more production, and more production meant more work.\n\nHe became much less happy when the Tsarist troops turned his factory, and many others like it in the industrial zone, into a warzone. Unemployed once again after the fall of the government to the Tsarists, he had scraped by as best as he was able. Until today, when he was informed that his skills were needed again, in the same factory. They would even provide transport.\n\nHe had not realized what it meant when that transport was a military truck. Stepping off at its destination, he recognized his factory, the walls and roof hastily repaired and with larger trucks rapidly disgorging equipment and machine tools. He also recognized the formation of Tsarist soldiers, assembled near the entrance and receiving orders from an officer.\n\nSoon the information was given to him and the other workers as well. They would be working, yes, but they would also be supervised. Closely. Sabotage had been reported elsewhere, and with the industrial power Central Siberia required for the advancement of the state, it would not be tolerated. Here or elsewhere.\n\nThat was fine with Fyodor. He just wanted to work. Whether it was for Novosibirsk's former regime or for the Tsarists made no difference. So he nodded, picked up his tools, and followed the others inside to his assigned station."
